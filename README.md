# Multi-Label Classification For Airplane Models

This is our final project for the course 02456 Deep learning at DTU. 

The project is about creating a multi-label classification model with deep learning. We want to classify which airplane models are contained within a string. 

The repository contains two files. The first one is the data wrangling - creating the training data, over/under-sampling and creating training, validation and test files. The secound one is the model and the evaluation of it. 

The data is provide by the company Beep Analytics and cannot be shared, but it is build from the FFA PMA parts database.
